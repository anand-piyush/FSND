# Udacity Full-Stack Developer Nanodegree Capstone Project
    This project is the final project for my Udacity FullStack Developer Nanodegree.

The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process.

This Application does not have a frontend implemented. It is a server only application at the moment.

## Application Heroku Link

**http://localhost:8080**

## Application Stack

The Application Tech Stack includes:
- **Python3**: The [server language](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Flask**: [Server Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- **PostgreSQL**: [Database](https://www.postgresql.org/) of choice
- **SQLAlchemy**: [ORM of choice](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to communicate between the python server and the Postgres Database. [Flask SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) is directly used.
- **Heroku**: [Deployment Platform](https://www.heroku.com/)
- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)**: Testing the Application Endpoints

    Create a local database and export the database URI as an environment variable with the key `DATABASE_PATH`.

6. **Run Database Migrations**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py db init
    python manage.py db migrate
    python manage.py db upgrade
    ```

7. **Run the Flask Application locally**:
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=myapp
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run
    ```
